# phe [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thlorenz/phe.png)](http://travis-ci.org/thlorenz/phe)

Poker hand evaluator, a port of [PokerHandEvaluator](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator).

It's super fast even though still 3x slower than the C version it was ported from, but hey you can use this directly
with Node.js or even in the browser.

It's fast, cause it's using a hash algorithm relying on masking and tables. However the table data isn't huge like I've
seen in other projects. This is possible because flushes are considered separately from other rankings

I highly recommend reading the [informative writeup on how this all
works](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/tree/master/Documentation).

```js
const { rankBoard, rankDescription } = require('phe')

const board = 'As Ks 4h Ad Kd'
const rank = rankBoard(board)
const name = rankDescription[rank]

console.log('%s is a %s', board, name)
```

```
As Ks 4h Ad Kd is a Two Pair
```

## Installation

    npm install phe

### evaluateCards

Evaluates the 5 - 7 cards to arrive at a number representing the hand
strength, smaller is better.

**Parameters**

-   `cards` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)>** the cards, i.e. `[ 'Ah', 'Ks', 'Td', '3c', 'Ad' ]`

Returns **[Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** the strength of the hand comprised by the cards

### evaluateCardsFast

Same as `evaluateCards` but skips `cards` argument type check to be more
performant.

**Parameters**

-   `cards`

### evaluateBoard

Evaluates the given board of 5 to 7 cards provided as part of the board to
arrive at a number representing the hand strength, smaller is better.

**Parameters**

-   `board` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the board, i.e. `'Ah Ks Td 3c Ad'`

Returns **[Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** the strength of the hand comprised by the cards of the board

### rankCards

Evaluates the 5 - 7 cards and then calculates the hand rank.

**Parameters**

-   `cards` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)>** the cards, i.e. `[ 'Ah', 'Ks', 'Td', '3c', 'Ad' ]`

Returns **[Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** the rank of the hand comprised by the cards, i.e. `1` for
`FOUR_OF_A_KIND` (enumerated in ranks)

### rankCardsFast

Same as `rankCards` but skips `cards` argument type check to be more
performant.

**Parameters**

-   `cards`

### rankBoard

ranks the given board of 5 to 7 cards provided as part of the board to
and then calculates the hand rank.

**Parameters**

-   `board` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the board, i.e. `'Ah Ks Td 3c Ad'`

Returns **[Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** the rank of the hand comprised by the cards, i.e. `1` for
`FOUR_OF_A_KIND` (enumerated in ranks)

### ranks

Enumeration of possible hand ranks, each rank is a number from 0-8.

    STRAIGHT_FLUSH
    FOUR_OF_A_KIND
    FULL_HOUSE
    FLUSH
    STRAIGHT
    THREE_OF_A_KIND
    TWO_PAIR
